# üìÇ Data Pipeline with Databricks

The primary purpose of this project is to design and develop an efficient data pipeline using Databricks. This pipeline should integrate data sources and destinations, emphasizing the designer's ability to perform extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) tasks effectively. The focus is on ensuring the efficiency and scalability of the pipeline, along with the proper configuration of data sources and destinations.

## üìå References

This project is guided by the official [Databricks Data Pipeline documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/data-pipeline-get-started.html). Please refer to this documentation for detailed information and best practices.

## üéµ Dataset

In this project, we will use a dataset suggested as an example in the Databricks documentation. This dataset is a subset of the Million Song Dataset, containing features and metadata for contemporary music tracks. You can access this dataset in the [sample datasets](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dbfs/databricks-datasets.html#databricks-datasets-databricks-datasets) included in the Databricks workspace.
